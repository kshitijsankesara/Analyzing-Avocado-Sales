# Analyzing-Avocado-Sales


For my IST 652: Scripting for Data Analysis course, I analyzed the Avacado Sales Data set which I found it on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/neuromusic/avocado-prices). The data records the historical prices and sales of Avocado in multiple US regions. My goal is to better understand the price trends and the factors which have a positive or a negative impact on Avocado sales in the United States. The data consisted of **18500 records and 13 attributes.**

**Data Exploration and Data Cleaning:**
1. Removed 3 columns which were not significant.
2. Changed data formats of multiple columns
3. Renamed all the columns.
4. Check for null values.
5. Use functions like describe() to understand the statistical summary of numerical columns.
6. Checked for unique values.
7. Plotted multiple visualizations
8. Perform groupby analysis

After exploring the data, I answered various important business questions to understand the data properly.

**Business Questions:**
1. What is the trend in the Total Volume and Total Bags sold of each type of Avocados over the years?
2. What is the trend in the Average Price of each type of Avocados sold over the years?
3. In which regions, the Avocados are the most expensive?
4. Which regions in the USA consume a lot of Avocados?
5. For each type of Avocado, what are the total volume and total bags sold?
